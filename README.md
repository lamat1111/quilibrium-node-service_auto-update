# How to use
This si a script to auto update the Node IF you are running it as a service.
To run the node as a service you can follow this guide: https://github.com/demipoet/demipoet.github.io, or this other guide (with auto-installer script): https://github.com/hedging8563/quilnode/blob/main/README.md

After you have succesfully installed everything and are running the node as a service, you can use this script to auto-update the node. The script checks for updates once a day, but you can edit the cronjob to check more often.
